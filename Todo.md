1. Calculating the SB by slope:
	Two ways:
	1. Fitting line on highest points.
	2. The highest point on left, highest point on right.
2. Write generalized method that takes in:
	1. $r$
	2. $x_0$
	3. $iterations$
	4. starting iteration (when do we start observing the pattern)
	5. size of random kick $\epsilon$ 
	6. probability of kick to $\epsilon$ 
	7. size of kick to $r$
	8. probability of kick to $r$ and returns:
		1. The slope of the SB plot.
		2. dictionary of pattern to probability
